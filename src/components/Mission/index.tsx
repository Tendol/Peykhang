              Peykhang is a one stop all for any individual interested in
              Tibetan literacy. Every time I wanted to read a book either
              written by a Tibetan author or pertaining to Tibet I needed to
              scourge the internet to find any good recommendations. Peykhang is
              a space for any Tibetans or Tibet enthusiasts to explore and learn
              about Tibet. You will find book recommendations ranging from
              fiction to non-fiction, and Buddhism to Science, written by
              Tibetan and non-Tibetan authors.
